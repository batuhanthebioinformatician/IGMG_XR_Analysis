Comparative Genomics and Structural Analysis of Phototrophicity Across Diverse Environments — Machine Learning, Entropy, and Graph-Based Applications

This repository provides computational tools integrating machine learning, information theory, and graph theory for comparative genomic and structural analysis of phototrophic proteins, with emphasis on xanthorhodopsins (XRs).
The scripts implement quantitative similarity scoring, unsupervised clustering, entropy profiling, and graph-based community detection to study functional and evolutionary patterns across diverse environments.

Repository Overview
Script	Description
XR_blosum45_matrix.py	Computes a pairwise BLOSUM45 similarity and distance matrix from a multiple sequence alignment (MSA). Serves as a foundation for clustering and graph construction.
XR_hdbscan_umap.py applies unsupervised clustering (HDBSCAN) to the similarity matrix and visualizes the relationships among proteins in 2D and 3D UMAP embeddings.
Tm_align_matrix_docker.py	performs all-versus-all structural alignment using TM-align inside a Docker container to generate a symmetric TM-score matrix for structural comparison.
Shannon_entropy_no_gaps.py	calculates position-wise Shannon entropy (natural log, gaps ignored) from an MSA to measure residue-level information content and evolutionary variability.
Build_psn_and_cluster.py	builds a Protein Similarity Network (PSN) from a BLOSUM45 similarity matrix. Supports k-nearest-neighbor and threshold-based graph construction, followed by community detection (Leiden or Louvain). Outputs graph files for Gephi or Cytoscape visualization.
